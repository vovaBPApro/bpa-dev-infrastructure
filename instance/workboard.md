# Workboard — open tracked rows

One row per open item. A row leaves this file only by landing (record the SHA
in the row, then delete it next pass) or by an explicit dropped-with-reason
note. Derived-work items live here; Human directives stay in
`instance/decisions/` and are only referenced.

## Open

- **W-08 — memory-sweep defect triage**: live sweep + triage DONE (proposal at
  `.cache/infra-lanes/diag/ag-memory-sweep-triage.report.md`: 38 memory entries
  + 3 oversized `.mdc` rules files). APPLICATION pending — adding `home:` anchors
  / demoting rules bodies is deliberate judgment work (several entries concern
  dead bpa-master rails); to be done by the NEW orchestrator post-cutover.
  (Sweep tool landed 05689cdd; daily timer installer exists, not yet installed.)
- **W-10 — install memory-sweep daily timer** on the host once W-08 triage
  is done (orchestrator/install-memory-sweep.sh).

### Migration-loss restore queue (2026-07-30)

Source: parity audit against the **live** old daemon at
`/root/orch-mailbox/live-daemon-src/` (29 files). An earlier audit used
`migration-prep/reference-daemon/`, which turned out to be the *template* the
live daemon was generated from — so it was blind to everything the live host
gained after diverging. Treat the live source as the baseline, not the snapshot.

**Enabler, verified**: the lost modules' own tests are in this repo's history —
`git ls-tree ffe05409:tools/claude-telegram-daemon/` carries
`alarm-router.test.ts`, `nudge-ledger.test.ts`, `status-collector.test.ts`,
`vendor-quota-scraper.test.ts`, `history-logger.test.ts`, `model-switch.test.ts`,
`mcp-rebind.integration.test.ts` and `test/orchestrator-watchdog.test.sh`. Start
every restore lane from `ffe05409`, not from scratch.

Only ONE of these losses had a recorded decision. The rest went silently — see
the governance row below.

- **ML-1 — terminal failure-alert bridge**: live classified 8 failure classes off
  `tmux pipe-pane` (usage limit, 429/overload, auth, stalled, failed, exited,
  network, fatal); ours has 3 regexes, all context-limit. We are blind to quota
  exhaustion and provider overload — they read as a generic stall. *lane*
- **ML-2 — autonomy keep-alive layer**: four live paths pushed the orchestrator
  (hourly `/compact`, 15-min fleet ping, maintenance audit, per-message reply
  chase). All gone; every `tmuxPasteText`/`tmuxSend` call site here is
  operator-initiated. The direction inverted — live pushed the orchestrator, ours
  pushes the Human. Contradicts `autonomy-and-capacity`. *lane*
- **ML-3 — heartbeat multi-signal liveness**: one ongoing writer (turn end), and
  stale heartbeat → kill with no alive-check, so a long Codex turn is killed
  mid-work. IN FLIGHT: `ag-watchdog-restores`.
- **ML-4 — `/health` `connected` is fail-open**: live computed
  `transportConnected && alive`; ours reports `activeServer !== null`, so it reads
  connected with a dead socket. *trivial*
- **ML-5 — preflight auth depth**: live banned 9 env vars incl.
  `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`/`USE_VERTEX`/`GEMINI_API_KEY` and grepped
  `~/.codex/auth.json` for an embedded key; ours checks 3. A metered-billing leak
  through the Human's "subscriptions only" rule. IN FLIGHT: `ag-watchdog-restores`.
- **ML-6 — vendor quota display**: Codex 5h/7d, Claude weekly/credits, and the
  "session expired — re-login" warning. Local `.jsonl` parsing, no browser. *lane*
- **ML-7 — alarm audience routing**: live split `internal` (orchestrator TUI) from
  `human` (Telegram) via an `x-bpa-alarm-audience` header; ours is single-audience,
  so all fleet telemetry pings the Human's phone. *lane*
- **ML-8 — per-message unanswered ledger**: live tracked every inbound per chat and
  nudged the orchestrator at 60s/90s before escalating. Ours keeps
  `most-recent-inbound-wins`, so a burst of 5 messages collapses to 1. *project*
- **ML-9 — `MISSION:` text parsing**: live parsed `MISSION: <text> | ttl=…` and
  `MISSION DONE/CLEAR` pre-dispatch. `grep parseHumanMissionCommand` → 0 hits
  here. Related dead seam: we still write `mission-inbox.log` and nothing reads
  it. *lane*
- **ML-10 — delivery fallback + detach detection**: `/reply`, `/ack`,
  `/mcp/rebind`, `/sendDocument`, `/sendPhoto` and `isMcpChannelDetached` all
  absent, so a dropped MCP channel has no alarm and no fallback. *lane*
- **ML-11 — bidirectional history logging**: no outbound record exists, so
  post-incident forensics is impossible. *lane*
- **ML-12 — watchdog escalation ladder**: collapsed to a flat hourly repeat; lost
  stall-tick ladder, multi-signal progress signature, 6 alert classes with
  signature-keyed suppression, and `HAS_TASK` passivity. *lane*
- **ML-13 — docker disk remediation**: ours detects and alerts only; live pruned
  at ≥80% and escalated at ≥88%, written after a real ENOSPC outage.
  IN FLIGHT: `ag-watchdog-restores`.
- **ML-14 — restart context re-analysis**: last ~12h of chat injected on restart
  with newest-wins reconciliation; a restarted orchestrator now resumes stale
  intent. *lane*
- **ML-15 — fleet/manager/lane visibility in `/status`**: manager tier, per-lane
  provider/model/branch/age, capacity gauge, spawn-failure signals. *project*
- **ML-16 — small user-visible losses**: `модель` bare-word alias; `/model`
  applying to the RUNNING session via `tmuxSend` (ours pins for next launch only);
  `/start_claude <plan>` argument; Codex updater-prompt skip; `Notification` hook
  → loud ping. *trivial each*

- **ML-GOV — no capability may leave the tree unrecorded**: none of ML-1..16 was
  routed through `instance/parked.md` and no `dropped: <reason>` row exists for
  any of them, though `migration-prep/INSTRUCTIONS_CONSILIUM_FINAL.md:315`
  requires exactly that. The one well-done drop is the Python removal — rationale
  in a doc, ideas preserved as a checklist in `daemon/ACCEPTANCE.md:5-9`. Make the
  requirement enforceable at the gate rather than in prose; an instruction nobody
  runs is how this happened. *lane*

### New-infra queue (post-cutover, from the Human 2026-07-30)

Build on the NEW orchestrator, planned WITH the Human there. Verbatim seed:
`instance/decisions/HR-11736.md`.
- **NI-1 — team personas**: give "characters"/personas to the whole 10-agent team.
- **NI-2 — Google Drive debug access**: proper GDrive file access for debugging.
- **NI-3 — local Whisper voice transcription**: local Whisper model to transcribe
  Telegram voice messages; needs testing + RAM measurement (251 GB headroom).

## Deep consilium residuals (2026-07-29)

Source: `migration-prep/DEEP_CONSILIUM_AUDIT_2026-07-29.md` (4 Codex auditors).
The CRITICAL/HIGH findings already LANDED: /status honesty (running_agents vs
lane_worktrees, git timeout) `7fe97222`; gate provenance 7 fixes incl.
self-review reviewer!=author + partial-identity + NUL-byte `b3a42d14`; dispatch
marker/override 3 fixes `c1ad0c7e`; flaky lease-race test `d1b64754`. These rows
were the remaining MEDIUM/LOW.

This audit is now FULLY CLOSED. All residuals landed (all review=accepted,
cross-vendor Claude Sonnet): W-07 batch --skip-review test coverage `274672f`;
W-09 handoff future-ts guard `e1af73c`; W-11 gate secret-scan decoded-match
lock `e172ff6` (base64-decode detection already shipped in `77f3fa9f`; entropy
excluded as too false-positive-prone; split-string documented as the residual
boundary); W-12 gate reviewer-identity hardening `1c920ba`; W-13 /status
process-local honesty relabel `fa2a974`.

## Parked (needs Human go or a phase flip)

- **P-01 — VM migration to the 64 GB machine** (`instance/migration-day.md`)
  — parked by HR-11570 («Поки роби лише 1») until Vova's go.
- **P-02 — stack Phase-0 spike with go/no-go numbers**
  (`migration-prep/STACK_CONSILIUM_FINAL.md`) — parked by HR-11570.
- **P-03 — daemon cutover to this repo's daemon/** (flips
  `capture.mode: manual → daemon` in `instance/params.yaml`; inbox ledger
  check then fail-closes) — needs the migration/cutover moment.
